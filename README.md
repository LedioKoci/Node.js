# Node.js CRUD API with MongoDB, Express.js, and Mongoose 

### Description 

This repository contains a simple Node.js server-side API developed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MongoDB as the database, Express.js as the web framework, and Mongoose as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library. Additionally, it incorporates the use of environment variables (.env) to securely store crucial database information.

### Features

- CRUD Operations: The API supports basic CRUD operations to interact with data stored in a MongoDB database.
- Express.js Integration: The Express.js framework is used to handle routing, middleware, and other web server functionalities.
- Mongoose ODM: Mongoose simplifies interaction with MongoDB by providing a schema-based solution for modeling application data.
- Secure Database Configuration: Database connection details such as the URL, credentials, and other sensitive information are stored in environment variables for enhanced security.
